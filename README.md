### HELLO!

My name is Sean Steele, and I am an aspiring researcher with interests in immunology, genetics, bioinformatics, and statistics.  I am particularly intrigued by the intersection of statistical modeling and biology, but I am also fascinated by the power of data analytics to shed light onto virtually any field. 

After graduating from Emory University in 2020, I worked at RayBiotech Life as a lead Research Technician. There I applied my statistical modeling skills directly into our workflow, overhauling our immuno-PCR development process. More recently I have pivoted my career path to focus more on data analytics, visualzations, and machine learning.  I am currently working as a Data Science Analyst at Softcrylic, where I am focused on ETL engineering and data visualization, as well as developing machine learning solutions.

Outside of my professional life I also enjoy investigating a myriad of questions with data analytics, including macro-economic trends surrounding oil prices, general stock market dynamics, and COVID-19 population infection dynamics. A sample of these side projects, as well as my open source professional projects are pinned below!
