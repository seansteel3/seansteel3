### HELLO!

My name is Sean Steele, and I am an aspiring researcher with interests in immunology, genetics, bioinformatics, and statistics.  I am particularly intrigued where data analytics and statistical modeling can shed light into new insights, both within biology and beyond!


For the last year or so I was working at RayBiotech Life my data modeling and prediction skills in R directly into our workflow, overhauling our optimization process. While I enjoyed my time in the lab, I now am working as a data science analyst at Softcrylic. For the foreseable future I am excited to explore my statistical interests in more detail professionally.
