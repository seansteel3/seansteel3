### HELLO!

My name is Sean Steele, and I am an aspiring researcher with interests in immunology, genetics, bioinformatics, and statistics.  I am particularly intrigued by the intersection of statistical modeling and biology, but also by the power of data analytics in shedding light into virtaully any field. 

Post graduation from Emory Univeristy in 2020, I worked at RayBiotech Life as a lead Research Technician. There I applied my statistical modeling skills directectly into our workflow, overhualing our immuno-PCR development process. More recently I have pivoted my career path to focus more on data anlytics.  I am currenlty working as a Data Science Analyst at Softcrylic, where my focus is on ETL engineering and Data Visualizations, as well as machine learning solutions.

Outside of my professional life I also enjoy investigating a myraid of questions with data analytics, including macro-economic trends sourounding oil prices, general stock market dynamics, and COVID-19 population infection dynamics.
